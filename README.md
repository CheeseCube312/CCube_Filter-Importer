# CheeseCube-Filter-Plotter//WPB.csv Importer
This import tool lets you turn WebPlotDigitizer .csv tables into a format you can actually use with my filter plotting tool


To install the venv you just run WPD_csv.bat

How to use:
Turn a graph into a .csv file using WebPlotDigitizer. Download the file. Run WPD_csv.bat, select the .csv file, enter whatever number and name you want to give the filter. Add a HexCode you want the graph to be in.
It will spit out a file in the right format for the plotter. Copy + Paste that file into filters_data.
